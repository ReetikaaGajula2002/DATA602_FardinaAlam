As a full-time student pursuing an MS in Data Science, I'm excited about taking DATA602. It's not just a box to tick for my degree requirements - I'm genuinely curious about the nitty-gritty of data manipulation. I'm looking forward to learning tricks and techniques that'll help me whip datasets into shape for machine learning models. That said, I've got a lot on my plate with other classes and commitments, so I'm a bit concerned about managing my time and energy. Still, I'm optimistic that the skills I'll pick up in this course will be worth the effort and help me become a more capable data scientist.
